# Etch-a-Sketch

an Odin Project Practical where i test my DOM manipulation skills.

## Instructions

>have a parent node -- div container
>style the parennt node with flexbox }
>```flex-wrap; width: fit-content; margin: 0 auto;```
>have two buttons start and reset

## Simulation

>user eneters number od grids for conatainer
>user can draw on conatiner by hovering over child nodes
>user can reset sketch container


## Progress

I have learnt that the for each method helps you target all of the elements stored in an ```array``` or ```parentNode``` its a function that targtes all the values stored in a domain letting u manipulate them anyway u want 

```arrayName.forEach((key) => { function code})```
 OR
  ```arrayName.forEach(function (key){ function code})```

  .forEach() is a function where u can use functions in you must:

  >target elements in specific doamin name

  ## Challenges 

I was not able to allow user to enter a value of the amount of grids they wanted as i ahd challenges in  the CSS code adjusting those grids (divs) to wrap.

> when they wrapped they left large horizontal spaces
